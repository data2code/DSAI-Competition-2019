# EC2 Team Solution in Novartis Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) Challenge 2019


The [Novartis DSAI Challenge 2019](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/novartis-dsai-challenge) aimed at predicting the Probability of Success (PoS) of a clinical candidate for a certain indication based on the data collected on Phase II trials.  This repository contains the solution submitted by team E2C, consisting of members from the [Genomics Insitute of the Novartis Research Foundation](https://www.gnf.org/).

# Dataset

The training data was based on two proprietary pharmaceutical pipeline databases provided by [Informa](https://pharmaintelligence.informa.com/)&copy; ([Pharmaprojects](https://pharmaintelligence.informa.com/products-and-services/data-and-analysis/pharmaprojects) and [Trialtrove](https://pharmaintelligence.informa.com/clinical-trial-data)), and we therefore do not  provide the raw or processed training and inference data in this repository.
